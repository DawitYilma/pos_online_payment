Intergrate Odoo POS With an online payment system.
I have integrated Odoo POS module with amole payment. Using POS-Amole integration any 
kind of payment can be done in POS by amole Fettan payment gateway API developed by 
Dashen Bank. This payment system makes money transaction fast and easy to use.
This system can only be used with system that has installed Odoo POS on their machine. Using 
Odoo POS Amole payment can easily be integrated just by adding some data to a field. Odoo 
POS have its own setup process that makes this kind of transactions convenient to use.
Amole payment has two ways of making payment. One is the direct Amole Pay and the other is 
Amole Event/Service. We will be showing how to configure and use in this system.
